# SCDL3991_UVCBs
Code for fingerprinting and clustering 141 petroleum UVCBs

1) Compiles all ECHA_CHEM files that were saved from database scraping, gathers all SMILES, trade names etc.
2) Covnerts anything possible for SMILES structures
3) Finds classifier presence from petroleum fingerprint
4) Gathers all of the secondary classifier data (CHNOS, PAH, C range)
5) Turns classsifiers into bindary fingerprint
6) Clustering
7) Comparison of clusters with bioactivity clusters and manufacturing classses


... comments and tidying up of the code TBD
